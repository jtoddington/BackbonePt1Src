Sample Backbone Code
====================

Sample Backbone code from dev tech talk on 15/01/12.

You need to drop this into a webserver to run it and then hit each of the HTML pages for the examples. 

Go through them in the following order as they progressively build on each other:

1. simpleModel.html
2. simpleCollection.html
3. simpleView.html
4. simpleRouter.html

*See the comments in the JS files for info and how to interact with the samples.*
